Title: Fixing table creation with streamOptions set to undefined

<!-- THANK YOU for your contribution to Dynamoose, we really appreciate you taking the time to improve this package, and look forward to reviewing your PR and getting the changes integrated into the package. Thanks again!! -->


### Summary:

`createTableRequest` reads `options.streamOptions.enabled`. The table options merge keeps an own property that is `undefined` over the default object, so `{"streamOptions": undefined}` (allowed by `TableOptionsOptional`, and common when options are built from config) throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'enabled')` while building the `createTable` request. It now reads `streamOptions?.enabled`.


### Code sample:
#### Model
```js
const Cat = dynamoose.model("Cat", {"id": String});
new dynamoose.Table("Cat", [Cat], {"streamOptions": undefined});
// Before: createTable rejects with a TypeError  After: created without a StreamSpecification
```


### Other information:

The streams option is not released yet (it is in PENDING_CHANGELOG), so no release has this bug.
